This app is to demonstrate the use of the following technologies:
- Rails 3.1
- MongoDB (with versioning)
- Sencha Touch

The app is basically a little note taking application. The only fancy thing it does is version your notes so you can retrieve a previous copy of the same note.

What's left to do:
 - the mobile interface
